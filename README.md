# ConditionCDVAE+

Our study presents an improved deep generative model based on the Crystal Diffusion VariationalÂ  Autoencoder ([CDVAE](https://github.com/txie-93/cdvae)), ConditionCDVAE+, which enables the inverse design of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures.
This is an implemented code from a paper titled "Deep generative model for the inverse design of 2D  heterostructures".
## Installation
Run the following command to install the environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Modify the following environment variables in `.env`.

- `PROJECT_ROOT`: path to the folder that contains this repo
- `HYDRA_JOBS`: path to a folder to store hydra outputs
- `WABDB`: path to a folder to store wabdb outputs

## Datasets

You can find a small sample of the dataset in `data/`, 
including the data used for ConditionCDVAE+ training. 
The complete data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

## Training and evaluation

training without condition command:
```
python ccdvaeplus/run.py data=j2dh-8 expname=j2dh-8 model=vae_withoutcondition
```

training  command:
```
python ccdvaeplus/run.py data=j2dh-8 expname=j2dh-8 model=vae
```

To generate materials without condition, run the following command:
```
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path MODEL_PATH --tasks gen
```

To generate materials with condition:
```
python scripts/Condition_guided_eval.py --model_path MODEL_PATH --tasks gen --prop PROP or --formula FORMULA
```

compute reconstruction & generation metrics (only on random gen data):
```
python scripts/compute_metrics.py --root_path ROOT_PATH --tasks recon gen
```
